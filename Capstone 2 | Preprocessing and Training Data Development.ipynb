    "# Housing Affordability Analysis in Massachusetts\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to investigate the affordability of different types of housing in Massachusetts, specifically focusing on 3-4 unit apartments. We aim to predict three different cost measures for these apartments: 'Monthly Owner Costs With Mortgage', 'Monthly Owner Costs Without Mortgage', and 'Monthly Renter Costs'. These cost measures are treated as a percentage of income spent on housing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these costs can provide insights into housing affordability and help guide decisions around housing policy and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we're using contains information about different types of housing across various locations in Massachusetts. The features include housing characteristics and location, while the targets are different measures of housing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can use this data for modeling, we need to preprocess it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Dummy Variables**: The 'Housing Type' and 'MA' (location) columns are categorical variables. Machine learning algorithms require numerical input, so we convert these categorical variables into dummy variables (also known as indicator variables). Each category within the original columns is turned into a new binary column in the dataframe.\n",
    "2. **Scale Numerical Features**: The numerical features in the dataset have different magnitudes, which can cause issues with some machine learning algorithms. To solve this, we standardize these features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing the data, we split it into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train our machine learning models, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of these models on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're creating three separate train-test splits, one for each target variable. This will allow us to train separate models for 'Monthly Owner Costs With Mortgage', 'Monthly Owner Costs Without Mortgage', and 'Monthly Renter Costs'. Each model will use all other columns in the dataset (except for the other target variables) as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next steps of this project, we'll train models on these datasets and evaluate their performance. This will help us understand how different housing characteristics and locations impact housing costs, and ultimately, housing affordability in Massachusetts."
