    "# Housing Affordability Analysis in Massachusetts\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an analysis of the affordability of different types of housing in Massachusetts, with a particular focus on 3-4 unit apartments. The goal is to develop a model that can predict three different cost measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monthly Owner Costs With Mortgage\n",
    "2. Monthly Owner Costs Without Mortgage\n",
    "3. Monthly Renter Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "These cost measures are treated as a percentage of income spent on housing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis involves the following key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Loading and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by loading the dataset and exploring its basic characteristics. This involves understanding the structure of the dataset, the features available, and the nature of the target variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train our machine learning models, and the testing set is used to evaluate the models' performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Model Building and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We build multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression, for each target variable. Each model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The models' performance is then improved by tuning their hyperparameters. We use GridSearchCV, which performs an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator."

For 'Monthly Owner Costs Without Mortgage', although Linear Regression has the lowest errors, its R-squared value is near zero, indicating that the model doesn't explain much of the variability in the data.
